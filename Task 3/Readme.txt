Password Generator 

 Task Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a password generator application in Python. The application allows users to specify the length and complexity of the password they want to generate. 

 Requirements:
1.User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
2. Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters (letters, digits, and special symbols) to generate a password of the specified length.
3. Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.


 Considerations:
- Security: The generated passwords are random and include a mix of characters, making them suitable for secure use.
- Customization: You can modify the character sets (`string.ascii_letters`, `string.digits`, `string.punctuation`) to suit specific requirements or policies.
- Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling for invalid input (non-integer lengths)

 Conclusion:
This documentation outlines the implementation of a password generator application in Python.
 It provides a clear overview of the functionality, implementation details, usage instructions, and considerations for further customization.
