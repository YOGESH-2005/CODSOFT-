To-Do List Application Using Tkinter in Python:


Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple To-Do List application using Python's Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to add tasks, update tasks, remove tasks, and sort tasks based on various criteria.

Features
Adding Task: Allows users to add new tasks to the to-do list.
Updating Task: Provides functionality to update existing tasks.
Removing Task: Enables users to remove tasks from the list.
Sorting Task: Supports sorting tasks by different criteria.
Data Persistence: All tasks are stored in a Java file for persistent storage.


Getting Started
To run the application:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script To do List.py.


Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.x and the Tkinter library, which is usually included with Python installations.

Usage:
Upon running the application, a GUI window will appear.
Use the buttons provided (Add Task, Update Task, Remove Task, Sort Task) to interact with the to-do list.
Changes made (addition, updates, deletions) are stored in a Java file (tasks.java).
